<h3>Double Every Third Number</h3>
	
<script>
//Design and implement a program that
//1. Asks the user to enter a series of numbers and stores numbers in the array. The
//series is of arbitrary size. Each time the user enters the number the program asks
//whether the user wants to enter one more number.
//2. Doubles every third number in the series. Stores the resulting series either in the
//same array or in a new one.
//Example: series 3 2 4 5 6 7 8 becomes 3 2 8 5 6 14 8.
//3. Outputs both the original and the modified arrays.		
//creat variables 	
var numbers = new Array();
var more; 	
var num;
var i=0;	
//input a number and store it in array	
do{	
//Asks the user to enter a series of numbers and stores numbers in the array.
num=prompt("Please, enter a number: ",""); 
num=parseFloat(num);	
numbers[i] = num;
i++;
more = confirm("One more number?");
}
//continue the input while more is true
while(more==true);	

//creat 2nd array	
var numbers_copy = new Array(numbers.length);

//copy array
for(i = 0; i<numbers.length; i++)
{  
numbers_copy[i]=numbers[i]; 
}	
	
//double every 3rd number in the copied array	
for (i=2;i<numbers_copy.length;i+=3)
{  
numbers_copy[i]=numbers_copy[i]*2;		
}



//Outputs the original array.	
document.write("Example: ")	

for (i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) 
{ 
	document.write(numbers[i]+" ");
}	


//Outputs the modified array.
document.write(" becomes ")	
for (i = 0; i < numbers_copy.length; i++) 
{ 
	document.write(numbers_copy[i]+" ");
