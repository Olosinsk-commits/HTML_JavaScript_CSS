  <h2>Cover your nose and mouth with a thick tissue.</h2>

  <p> This is the best way to contain your germs. Cold virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza are are passed by droplets in the air.
    <br> Releasing these viruses through sneezing and coughing is the main way these diseases are spread.
    <br>Practicing respiratory etiquette (covering your mouth and nose, washing your hands, etc.) can help reduce the chances you'll get anyone else sick.
    <br>Make sure to dispose of your used tissues right away to help prevent them from spreading your germs.

  <h2>Sneeze into your elbow. </h2>

  <p> If you don't have a tissue, the best way to catch your sneeze is to bend your elbow and hold it close to your face while sneezing.
    <br> This works best if you are wearing long sleeves. The goal is to contain the sneeze with your clothing so it doesn't spread into the air.</p>
  <h2>Don't sneeze into your hands. </h2>
  <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Sopli_2" style="width:304px;height:228px;">
  <p>Don't sneeze into your hands. Even though your hands might contain the sneeze, think about how many things you will have to touch with them!
    <br> You will only be spreading germs around as you touch things. While sneezing into your hands is not desirable, it is definitely preferable to not<br> containing your sneeze at all.
    <br>If you have nothing else to sneeze into and sneeze into your hands, make sure you wash your hands immediately.
    <br>You can also use hand sanitizer for this purpose as well.</p>
