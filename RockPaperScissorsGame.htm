<h3>Rock, Paper, Scissors Game</h3>
	
<script>
//Design and implement a program that lets the user play the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. 
///The program should work as follows. 
//1. When the program begins, a random number in the range 1 through 3 is
//generated. If the number is 1, then the computer has chosen rock. If the number is 2, then the computer has chosen paper. 
//If the number is 3, then the computer has chosen scissors. (Don’t display the computer’s choice yet.)
//2. The user enters his or her choice of “rock”, “paper” or “scissors” at the keyboard.
//3. The computer’s choice is displayed. 
//4. The program should display a message indicating weather the user or the computer was the winner. 
//A winner is selected according to the following rules:
//o If one player chooses rock and the other player chooses scissors, then the rock wins. (The rock smashes the scissors.) 
//o If one player chooses scissors and the other player chooses paper, then the scissors wins. (Scissors cuts paper.) 
//o If one player chooses paper and the other player chooses rock, then the paper wins. (Paper wraps rock.) 
//o If both players make the same choice, the game must be played again to determine the winner.

//If the number is 1, then the computer has chosen rock. If the number is 2, then the computer has chosen paper.
